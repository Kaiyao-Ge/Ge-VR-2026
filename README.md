# Ge-VR-2026

Kaiyao Ge's coursework fork of the [class repository](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/VR-2026-Fall). Each homework assignment has its own branch; this branch is `hw1`.

## HW1 — A Handful of Time

An interactive solar-system sandbox: use a controller beam to turn any planet and advance or reverse one shared clock for all eight planets. Controller haptics, multiplayer turn-taking, and an animated Earth–Moon hierarchy combine with one-hand movement and two-hand scaling to turn a tabletop model into an immersive star map.

- [Project description, controls, and verification](doc/hw1.md)
- [Scene source](js/scenes/solarSystem.js) · [Regression tests](tests/solar-system.test.cjs)
- [HW1 submission branch](https://github.com/Kaiyao-Ge/Ge-VR-2026/tree/hw1)
- [Ready-to-use BrightSpace description](doc/hw1.md#brightspace-submission)

Use Node 18 and the setup instructions below, then follow the [HW1 launch instructions](doc/hw1.md#running-the-scene). Select `solarSystem` in the scene list and enter an immersive WebXR session with controllers. Desktop viewing is a preview, not the interactive headset experience.

## Original course documentation

The instructions below are retained from the course repository. Browser flags and menu names may differ on your headset; use your working WebXR access configuration for HW1.
